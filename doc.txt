JQuery
1. I used select elements to group countries and cities. 
2. Added jquery script for the selection function
3. Added "is" class to select all className with is
4. class name of divs that is hidden should have same className prepend "is" with select option value.
5. Used slideDown, slideUp, removeclass addClass function to manipulate the hide and show of data.

For JSON and JS:
1. I manipulated the JSON provided a bit. I make it nested to properly make a groupings for countires and cities.

2. I make a function with parameters such as countries an cities then loop through the json and look for according to the countries or cities to show, and created a variables such as countryName and cityName to go through inside the datas. You can see it on the first column of the divs.

3.And make a variable output to output the divs and data dynamically
